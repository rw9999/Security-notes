# Identity and Access Management

Identities are one of the most important security layers in modern organizations. Identities, and the accounts they are connected to, allow those organizations to control who has access to their systems and services; to identify the actions that users, systems, and services are performing; and to control the rights that those accounts have and don't have

A well-designed identity and access management architecture and implementation is critical to how organizations work.

### Identity

Identities are the sets of claims made about a subject. Subjects are typically people, applications, devices, or organizations, but the most common application of identity is to individuals.

Identities are typically linked to information about the subject, including details that are important to the use of their identity. This information includes attributes, or information about the subject.

Attributes can include a broad range on information, from name, age, location, or job title, to physical attributes like hair and eye color or height.

Attributes are sometimes differentiated from traits. When used this way, attributes are changeable things, like the subject's title or address, whereas traits are inherent to the subject, such as height, eye color, or place of birth.

When a subject wants to use their identity, they need to use one of a number of common ways to assert or claim an identity:

- Usernames, the most commonly used means of claiming an identity. It is important to remember that usernames are  associated with an identity and are not an authentication factor themselves.

- Certificates, which can be stored on a system or paired with a storage device or security token.

- Tokens, a physical device that may generate a code, plug in via USB, or connect via Bluetooth or other means to present a certificate or other information.

- SSH keys, which are cryptographic representations of identity that replace a username and password.

- Smartcards use an embedded chip. Both contactless and physical chip readerâ€“capable cards as well as hybrid cards are broadly deployed, and cryptographic smartcards

# Malicious Code

**Malware** - describes a wide range of software that is intentionally designed to cause harm to systems and devices, networks, or users

Malware comes in many forms, from ransomware and remote access Trojans to Trojans, bots, and the command-and-control infrastructures that allow attackers to run entire networks of compromised systems

Can gather information, provide illicit access, and take a broad range of actions that the legitimate owner of a system or network may not want to occur

### Ransomware

Malware that takes over a computer and then demands a ransom

Many types of ransomware

Crypto-malware which encrypts files and then holds them hostage until a ransom is paid

Other ransomware techniques include threatening to report the user to law enforcement due to pirated software or pornography, or threatening to expose sensitive information or pictures from the victim's hard drive or device

One of the most important defenses against ransomware is an effective backup system that stores files in a separate location that will not be impacted if the system or device it backs up is infected and encrypted by ransomware

#### Trojans

Malware that is typically disguised as legitimate software

Rely on unsuspecting individuals running them, thus providing attackers with a path into a system or device

**Remote access Trojans (RATs)** - provide attackers with remote access to systems and monitoring of a system for attackers

Security practitioners often combat Trojans and RATs using a combination of security awareness—to encourage users to not download untrusted software—and antimalware tools that detect Trojan and RAT-like behavior and known malicious files

### Worms

Worms spread themselves and self-install, rather than requiring users to click on them

Spread via attacks on vulnerable services, email attachments, network file shares, or other methods

>[!#NOTE]

2010 Stuxnet attack is generally recognized as the first implementation of a worm as a cyber weapon

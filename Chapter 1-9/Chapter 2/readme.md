# Cybersecurity Threat Landscape

### Classifying Cybersecurity Threats

Characteristics to keep in mind:

Internal vs. External

Level of Sophistication/Capibilty

Resources/Funding

Intent/Motivation

**White-hat hackers** - known as authorized attackers, are those who act with authorization and seek to discover security vulnerabilities with the intent of correcting them

**Black-Hat Hackers** - known as unauthorized attackers, are those with malicious intent

**Gray-Hat Hackers** - known as semi-authorized attackers, are those who fall somewhere between white- and black-hat hackers. They act without proper authorization, but they do so with the intent of informing their targets of any security vulnerabilities

**Hacktivists** - use hacking techniques to accomplish some activist goal

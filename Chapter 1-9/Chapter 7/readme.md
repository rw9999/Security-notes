# Cryptography and the Public Key Infrastructure

The practice of encoding information in a manner that it cannot be decoded without access to the required decryption key

Cryptography consists of two main operations: **encryption**, which transforms plain-text information into ciphertext using an encryption key, and **decryption**, which transforms ciphertext back into plain text using a decryption key.

A **cipher** is a method used to scramble or obfuscate characters to hide their value. Ciphering is the process of using a cipher to do that type of scrambling to a message.

The two primary types of nonmathematical cryptography, or ciphering methods, are **substitution** and **transposition**.

### Substitution Ciphers

A type of coding or ciphering system that changes one character or symbol into another.

**Caesar cipher** - The system involves simply shifting all letters a certain number of spaces in the alphabet.

Decrypting a message encrypted with the Caesar cipher follows the reverse process.

ROT13, or “rotate 13,” is another simple substitution cipher. The ROT13 cipher works the same way as the Caesar cipher but rotates every letter 13 places in the alphabet.

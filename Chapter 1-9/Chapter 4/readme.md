# Chapter 4 Social Engineering, Physical, and Password Attacks

### Social Engineering

The practice of manipulating people through a variety of strategies to accomplish desired actions. Social engineers work to influence their targets to take actions that they might not otherwise have taken.

Key principles:

- **Authority** relies on the fact that most people will obey someone who appears to be in charge or knowledgeable, regardless of whether or not they actually are.

i.e A social engineer using the principle of authority may claim to be a manager, a government official, or some other person who would have authority in the situation they are operating in.
  
- **Intimidation** relies on scaring or bullying an individual into taking a desired action. The individual who is targeted will feel threatened and respond by doing what the social engineer wants them to do.
  
- **Consensus-based** social engineering uses the fact that people tend to want to do what others are doing to persuade them to take an action.

i.e. A consensus-based social engineering attack might point out that everyone else in a department had already clicked on a link, or might provide fake testimonials about a product making it look safe. Consensus is called “social proof” in some categorization schemes
  
- **Scarcity** is used in scenarios that make something look more desirable because it may be the last one available.
  
- **Familiarity-based** attacks rely on you liking the individual or even the organization the individual is claiming to represent.

- **Trust** much like familiarity, relies on a connection with the individual they are targeting. Unlike with familiarity, which relies on targets thinking that something is normal and thus familiar
  
- **Urgency** relies on creating a feeling that the action must be taken quickly due to some reason or reasons.

# Resilience and Physical Security

Building a resilient, secure infrastructure requires an understanding of the risks that your organization may face.

Natural and human-created disasters, physical attacks, and even accidents can all have a serious impact on your organization's ability to function.

Physical security can help provide greater resilience as well as protecting data and systems. Physical access to systems, networks, and devices is one of the easiest ways to bypass or overcome security controls, making physical security a key design element for secure organizations.

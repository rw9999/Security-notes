_Main goals of Cybersecurity_

**Confidentiality** - ensures that unauthorized individuals are not able to gain access to sensitive information

&emsp;&emsp;i.e. firewalls, access control lists, and encryption

**Integrity** - ensures that there are no unauthorized modifications to information or systems

&emsp;&emsp;i.e. hashing and monitoring solutions

**Availability** - ensures that information and system are ready to meet the needs of legitimate users at the time those users request them

&emsp;&emsp;i.e fault tolerance, clustering, and backup

_Key Threats to Cybersecurity_

**Disclosure** - the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized individuals, known as **_data loss_**

&emsp;&emsp;i.e. Attackers who gain access to sensitive information and remove it from the organization are said to be performing data exfiltration 

**Alteration** - the unauthorized modification of information

&emsp;&emsp;i.e. Attackers may seek to modify records contained in a system for financial gain, such as adding fraudulent transactions to a financial account. Alteration may occur as the result of natural activity, such as a power surge causing a “bit flip” that modifies stored data. Accidental alteration is also a possibility if users unintentionally modify information stored in a critical system as the result of a typo or other unintended activity.

**Denial** - the unintended disruption of an authorized user's legitimate access to information

&emsp;&emsp;i.e. availability loss may be intentional, such as when an attacker launches a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against a website. Denial may also occur as the result of accidental activity, such as the failure of a critical server, or as the result of natural activity, such as a natural disaster impacting a communications circuit

<ins>Breach Impact<ins>

**_Security incidents_** occur when an organization experiences a breach of the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of information or information systems. Security professionals are responsible for understanding these risks and implementing controls designed to manage those risks to an acceptable level. They must understand the effects that a breach might have on the organization and the impact it might have on an ongoing basis

**Financial Risk** - the risk of monetary damage to the organization as the result of a data breach

**Reputational Risk** - occurs when the negative publicity surrounding a security breach casues the loss of goodwill amoung customers, employees, suplliers, and other stakeholders

**Strategic Risk** - the risk that an organization will become less efective in meeting its major goals and objectives as a result of the breach

**Operational Risk** - risk to the organization's ability to carry out its day-to-day functions

**Compliance Risk** - occurs when a security breach causes an organiztion to run afoul of legal or regulatory requirments

>[!NOTE]
Risks can often cross categories

##

<ins>Security Control Categories<ins>

**Technical Controls** - enforce confidentiality, integrity, and availability in the digital space

&emsp;&emsp;i.e. firewall rules, access control lists, intrusion prevention systems, and encryption

**Operational Controls** - the processes that we put in place to manage technology in a secure manner

&emsp;&emsp;i.e. access reviews, log monitoring, and vulnerability management

**Managerial controls** - procedural mechanisms that focus on the mechanics of the risk management process

&emsp;&emsp;i.e. periodic risk assessments, security planning exercises, and the incorporation of security into the organization's change management, service acquisition, and project management practices

##

<ins>Security Control Types<ins>

**Preventitive Controls** - intend to stop a security issue before it occurs 

&emsp;&emsp;i.e. firewalls and encryption

**Detective Controls** - identify security events that have already occurred

&emsp;&emsp;i.e. intrusion detection systems (ids)

**Corrective controls** - remediate security issues that have already occurred

&emsp;&emsp;i.e. restoring backups after a ransomware attack

**Deterrent controls** - seek to prevent an attacker from attempting to violate security policies

&emsp;&emsp;i.e. vicious guard dogs and barbed wire fences

**Physical controls** - security controls that impact the physical world

&emsp;&emsp;i.e. fences, perimeter lighting, locks, fire suppression systems, and burglar alarms

**Compensating controls** - controls designed to mitigate the risk associated with exceptions made to a security policy

### Data Protection

**Data at rest** - stored data that resides on hard drives, tapes, in the cloud, or on other storage media

**Data in motion** - data that is in transit over a network

**Data in processing** - data that is actively in use by a computer system. includes the data stored in memory while processing takes place

Data Encryption

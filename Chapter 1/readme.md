_Main goals of Cybersecurity_

**Confidentiality** - ensures that unauthorized individuals are not able to gain access to sensitive information

&emsp;&emsp;i.e. firewalls, access control lists, and encryption

**Integrity** - ensures that there are no unauthorized modifications to information or systems

&emsp;&emsp;i.e. hashing and monitoring solutions

**Availability** - ensures that information and system are ready to meet the needs of legitimate users at the time those users request them

&emsp;&emsp;i.e fault tolerance, clustering, and backups

_Key Threats to Cybersecurity_

**Disclosure** - the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized individuals, known as **_data loss_**

&emsp;&emsp;i.e. Attackers who gain access to sensitive information and remove it from the organization are said to be performing data exfiltration 



**Alteration** - the unauthorized modification of information

&emsp;&emsp;i.e.Attackers may seek to modify records contained in a system for financial gain, such as adding fraudulent transactions to a financial account

&emsp;&emsp;Alteration may occur as the result of natural activity, such as a power surge causing a “bit flip” that modifies stored data. 

&emsp;&emsp;Accidental alteration is also a possibility if users unintentionally modify information stored in a critical system as the result of a typo or other unintended activity.

**Denial** - the unintended disruption of an authorized user's legitimate access to information

&emsp;&emsp;i.e.

<ins>Breach Impact<ins>

**_Security incidents_** occur when an organization experiences a breach of the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of information or information systems. Security professionals are responsible for understanding these risks and implementing controls designed to manage those risks to an acceptable level. They must understand the effects that a breach might have on the organization and the impact it might have on an ongoing basis

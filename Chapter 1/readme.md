Main goals of Cybersecurity

**Confidentiality** - ensures that unauthorized individuals are not able to gain access to sensitive information

i.e. firewalls, access control lists, and encryption

**Integrity** - ensures that there are no unauthorized modifications to information or systems

i.e. hashing and monitoring solutions

**Availability** - ensures that information and system are ready to meet the needs of legitimate users at the time those users request them

i.e fault tolerance, clustering, and backups

# Endpoint Security

Protecting endpoints in your organization is a significant portion of the daily tasks for many security professionals. For most organizations, endpoints significantly outnumber the servers and network devices, and since end users control or use them, they also have a wide variety of threats that they face that a server is unlikely to deal with.

## Protecting Endpoints

As a security professional, you'll be asked to recommend, implement, manage, or assess security solutions intended to protect desktops, mobile devices, servers, and a variety of other systems found in organizations. 

These devices are often called endpoints, meaning they're an end point of a network, whether that is a wired or wireless network.

With such a broad range of potential endpoints, the menu of security options is also very broad.

As a security practitioner, you need to know what options exist, where and how they are commonly deployed, and what considerations you need to take into account.

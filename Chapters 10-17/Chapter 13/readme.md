# Wireless and Mobile Security

Significant portions of the networks in most organizations are now wireless, and wireless networks have a number of security challenges that wired networks don't. 

They broadcast their signal, and they are frequently accessible from outside of the spaces that organizations own and manage. 

Cellular and point-to-point commercial wireless networks aren't even in the control of customers at all, which means that the traffic they carry may need to be treated as if it is traversing a potentially hostile network path.

## Building Secure Wireless Networks

Wireless networks are found throughout our organizations. From enterprise networks that authenticate users and that are managed and monitored using powerful tools, to simple wireless routers used in homes and small businesses to provide connectivity to residents, customers, or guests, Wi-Fi is everywhere. 

Wi-Fi networks aren't the only type of network that you will encounter, howeverâ€”Bluetooth, cellular, Zigbee, and other types of connectivity are also found in organizations.

Unlike wired networks, these wireless networks don't stop outside the walls of your organization, making wireless network security a very different challenge to secure. 

The fact that many devices have the ability to create ad hoc wireless networks, or to bridge their wired and wireless network connections, means that devices throughout your organization may also end up being paths to the network or to the device itself for malicious actors.

## Connectivity Methods

Designing a secure network often starts with a basic understanding of the type of network connectivity that you will be deploying or securing.

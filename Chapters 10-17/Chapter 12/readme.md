# Network Security

Networks are at the core of our organizations, transferring data and supporting the services that we rely on to conduct business. That makes them a key target for attackers and a crucial layer in defensive architecture and design.

### Designing Secure Networks

As a security professional, you must understand and be able to implement key elements of design and architecture found in enterprise networks in order to properly secure them.

Security designs in most environments rely on the concept of **defense in depth**.

In other words, they are built around multiple controls design to ensure that a failure in a single control—or even multiple controls—is unlikely to cause a security breach.

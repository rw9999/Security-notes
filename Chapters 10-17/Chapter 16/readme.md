# Security Policies, Standards, and Compliance

Policy serves as the foundation for any cybersecurity program, setting out the principles and rules that guide the execution of security efforts throughout the enterprise.

Often, organizations base these policies on best practice frameworks developed by industry groups such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). 

In many cases, organizational policies are also influenced and directed by external compliance obligations that regulators impose on the organization.

### Understanding Policy Documents**

An organization's **information security policy framework contains a series of documents designed to describe the organization's cybersecurity program.

The scope and complexity of these documents vary widely, depending on the nature of the organization and its information resources. 

These frameworks generally include four different types of document:

- Policies
- Standards
- Procedures
- Guidelines

Keep in mind that the definitions of these categories vary significantly from organization to organization and it is very common to find the lines between them blurred.

Though at first glance that may seem incorrect, it's a natural occurrence as security theory meets the real world. 

As long as the documents are achieving their desired purpose, there's no harm and no foul.

### Policies

Policies are high-level statements of management intent. 

Compliance with policies is mandatory.

An information security policy will generally contain broad statements about cybersecurity objectives, including the following:

- A statement of the importance of cybersecurity to the organization

- Requirements that all staff and contracts take measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and information systems

- Statement on the ownership of information created and/or possessed by the organization

- Designation of the chief information security officer (CISO) or other individual as the executive responsible for cybersecurity issues

- Delegation of authority granting the CISO the ability to create standards, procedures, and guidelines that implement the policy

In many organizations, the process to create a policy is laborious and requires very high-level approval, often from the chief executive officer (CEO).

Keeping policy statements at a high level provides the CISO with the flexibility to adapt and change specific security requirements with changes in the business and technology environments.

For example, the five-page information security policy at the University of Notre Dame simply states

"The Information Governance Committee will create handling standards for each Highly Sensitive data element. Data stewards may create standards for other data elements under their stewardship. These information handling standards will specify controls to manage risks to University information and related assets based on their classification. All individuals at the University are responsible for complying with these controls."

By way of contrast, the federal government's Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has a 95-page information security policy. This mammoth document contains incredibly detailed requirements, such as

"A record of all requests for monitoring must be maintained by the CMS CIO along with any other summary results or documentation produced during the period of monitoring. The record must also reflect the scope of the monitoring by documenting search terms and techniques. All information collected from monitoring must be controlled and protected with distribution limited to the individuals identified in the request for monitoring and other individuals specifically designated by the CMS Administrator or CMS CIO as having a specific need to know such information."

The CMS document even goes so far as to include a complex chart describing the many cybersecurity roles held by individuals throughout the agency.

This approach may meet the needs of CMS, but it is hard to imagine the long-term maintenance of that document. Lengthy security policies often quickly become outdated as necessary changes to individual requirements accumulate and become neglected because staff are weary of continually publishing new versions of the policy.

Organizations commonly include the following documents in their information security policy library:

- **Information security policy** that provides high-level authority and guidance for the security program.
- **Acceptable use policy (AUP)** that provides network and system users with clear direction on permissible uses of information resources
- **Data governance policy** that clearly states the ownership of information created or used by the organization.
- **Data classification policy** that describes the classification structure used by the organization and the process used to properly assign classifications to data.
- **Data retention policy** that outlines what information the organization will maintain and the length of time different categories of work product will be retained prior to destruction.
- **Credential management policy** that describes the account lifecycle from provisioning through active use and decommissioning. This policy should include specific requirements for personnel who are employees of the organization as well as third-party contractors. It should also include requirements for credentials used by devices, service accounts, and administrator/root accounts.

# Risk Management and Privacy

Organizations face an almost dizzying array of cybersecurity risks, ranging from the reputational and financial damage associated with a breach of personal information to the operational issues caused by a natural disaster.

The discipline of risk management seeks to bring order to the process of identifying and addressing these risks.

### Analyzing Risk

We operate in a world full of risks. If you left your home and drove to your office this morning, you encountered a large number of risks. You could have been involved in an automobile accident, encountered a train delay, or been struck by a bicycle on the sidewalk. We're aware of these risks in the back of our minds, but we don't let them paralyze us. 

Instead, we take simple precautions to help manage the risks that we think have the greatest potential to disrupt our lives.

In an **enterprise risk management (ERM)** program, organizations take a formal approach to risk analysis that begins with identifying risks, continues with determining the severity of each risk, and then results in adopting one or more **risk management** strategies to address each risk.

Before we move too deeply into the risk assessment process, let's define a few important terms that we'll use during our discussion:

- **Threats** are any possible events that might have an adverse impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of our information or information systems.

- **Vulnerabilities** are weaknesses in our systems or controls that could be exploited by a threat.

-  **Risks** occur at the intersection of a vulnerability and a threat that might exploit that vulnerability. A threat without a corresponding vulnerability does not pose a risk, nor does a vulnerability without a corresponding threat.

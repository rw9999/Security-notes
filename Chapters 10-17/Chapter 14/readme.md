# Incident Response

When things go wrong, organizations need a way to respond to incidents to ensure that their impact is limited and that normal operations can resume as quickly as possible. 

That means you need to know how to identify an incident given a series of events or data points, how to contain the incident, and then what to do about it

No matter how strong an organization's security protections are, eventually something will go wrong. Whether that involves a direct attack by a malicious actor, malicious software, an insider threat, or even just a simple mistake, a security incident is an eventuality for all organizations.

Organizations therefore need an incident response (IR) plan, process, and team, as well as the technology, skills, and training to respond appropriately.

A strong incident response process is not just a one-time action or something that is applied only in emergencies. Instead, IR is an ongoing process that improves organizational security using information that is learned from each security incident.

Although individual organizations may define them differently, in general an **incident** is a violation of the organization's policies and procedures or security practices.

**Events**, on the other hand, are an observable occurrence, which means that there are many events, few of which are likely to be incidents.

### The Incident Response Process

The first step toward a mature incident response capability for most organizations is to understand the incident response process and what happens at each stage. Although organizations may use slightly different labels or steps and the number of steps may vary, the basic concepts remain the same.

Organizations must prepare for incidents, identify incidents when they occur, and then contain and remove the artifacts of the incident.

Once the incident has been contained, the organization can work to recover and return to normal, and then make sure that the lessons learned from the incident are baked into the preparation for the next time something occurs.

The six steps you will need to know for the Security+ exam are as follows:

1. **Preparation.** In this phase, you build the tools, processes, and procedures to respond to an incident. That includes building and training an incident response team, conducting exercises, documenting what you will do and how you will respond, and acquiring, configuring, and operating security tools and incident response capabilities.

2. **Identification.** This phase involves reviewing events to identify incidents. You must pay attention to indicators of compromise, use log analysis and security monitoring capabilities, and have a comprehensive awareness and reporting program for your staff.

3. **Containment.** Once an incident has been identified, the incident response team needs to contain it to prevent further issues or damage. Containment can be challenging and may not be complete if elements of the incident are not identified in the initial identification efforts.

4. **Eradication.** The eradication stage involves removing the artifacts associated with the incident. In many cases, that will involve rebuilding or restoring systems and applications from backups rather than simply removing tools from a system since proving that a system has been fully cleaned can be very difficult. Complete eradication and verification is crucial to ensuring that an incident is over.

5. **Recovery.** Restoration to normal is the heart of the recovery phase. That may mean bringing systems or services back online  or other actions that are part of a return to operations. Recovery requires eradication to be successful, but it also involves implementing fixes to ensure that whatever security weakness, flaw, or action that allowed the incident to occur has been remediated to prevent the event from immediately reoccurring.

6. **Lessons learned.** These are important to ensure that organizations improve and do not make the same mistakes again. They may be as simple as patching systems or as complex as needing to redesign permission structures and operational procedures. Lessons learned are then used to inform the preparation process, and the cycle continues.

Although this list may make it appear as if incidents always proceed in a linear fashion from item to item, many incidents will move back and forth between stages as additional discoveries are made or as additional actions are taken by malicious actors.

So, you need to remain nimble and understand that you may not be in the phase you think you are, or that you need to operate in multiple phases at once as you deal with components of an incidentâ€”or multiple incidents at once.

### Preparing for Incident Response

The next step after understanding and defining an organization's IR process is to determine who will be on the organization's IR team, who will be in charge of the IR process, and who will lead the IR team. Next, plans are built, and then the plans are tested via exercises.

### Incident Response Team

Building an IR team involves finding the right members for the team.

Typical teams often include the following:

- A member of management or organizational leadership. This individual will be responsible for making decisions for the team and will act as a primary conduit to senior management for the organization. Ideally, teams should have a leader with enough seniority to make decisions for the organization in an emergency.
